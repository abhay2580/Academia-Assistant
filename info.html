<h1>About us</h1><hr>



<div>Managing complaints is favorable business practice for ensuring excellent customer service in a company. By having complaint management systems in place, businesses can use the information that is captured to make process improvements.According to Customer Expressions, effective complaint management systems should contain features, such as a centralized location for customers to report complaints, a system for storing complaints, a process for logging complaints, a method for acknowledging complaints (such as letters to the customers), a process for investigating complaints and then a way of resolving and following up with the complaints.</div>
